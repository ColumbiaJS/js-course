## Columbia Course in Advanced Javascript, Spring 2014

### [COURSE WIKI PAGE](https://github.com/ColumbiaJS/js-course/wiki)

[Please refer to the course wiki for all relevant course info, including course overview, syllabus, homework assignments, JavaScript fundamentals, etc.](https://github.com/ColumbiaJS/js-course/wiki)


### How this repo was created:

This repo was created using hub and the following commands ([for more on hub, a tool created to help you win at git](http://github.com/github/hub))

(mcd is a shortcut command for mkdir [dirName] && cd [dirName])

```sh
$ mcd js-course
$ hub init
$ touch README.md
$ hub add . && hub commit -m "initial commit"
$ hub create [optional_organization_name]/[repo_name] -d "[repo_description]"
$ hub push origin master
```

### Repo Dotfiles:

1. **.editorconfig**
  .editorconfig is used to define a consistent coding style across editors and IDEs (in terms of tab style (tab or spaces), tab width, character set, etc.).  To use this with your editor or IDE, simply go to http://editorconfig.org/ and, under "Download a Plugin", click on your editor/IDE.  Not all of these links are actual downloads.  For example, the Sublime Text icon will take you to the editorcongif plugin for Sublime Text repo page.  This is because Sublime Text has a package installer built in (you can access it with ctrl+shift+p and then typing package and clicking on Package Control: Install Package and searching for and installing editorconfig - Sublime Text will handle the rest for you).

2. **.gitignore**
  almost every large project has directories and specific files that should not be tracked by git.  For example, temp files that are generated by editors like vim and represent previous file state, files that are built automatically using a build tool and should always be generated automatically, or files that contain sensitive information (like API keys) and should not be exposed in a repo.

## Some Epictetus to Live By

*On Self-improvement*

> If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid. ― Epictetus

*And slowing down one's thought process*

> The actual process of self-improvement is initially a matter of consciously slowing down one's thought processes to allow for reflection prior to assent. “Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are, and what you represent” (2.18.24). As the habit of screening impressions becomes established, correct responses will begin to come automatically. Yet constant vigilance is still required, to guard against backsliding (4.3). One can never rely solely on habituation.

## JavaScript Style

[JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) will be the primary enforcer of JavaScript coding conventions in this course, but as we get deeper into the language, we'll also start to look at the two style guides below to give us more detailed guidance. JSHint will be run whenever you save out your files (I'll provide you with seed projects that already have the tooling you need all set up and ready to go, but I'll also spend some time introducing you to JavaScript's most popular build tools).

Refer to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml) as a general guide.  I will disagree with it on some points as we get deeper into the language, but we'll take it as a nice baseline.

Once we start to work with more advanced code, we'll start to adhere more closely to [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) in terms of how we write our code (even outside of Angular).

## Books
*Please note that you can get many of these books for free when you subscribe to either tutsplus.com ($90/year for a student membership, which quickly pays for itself in books) or to PacktPub directly, for the PacktPub books.*

##### Read First:
* [Object-Oriented JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-JavaScript-Edition-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/1849693129/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) - Stoyan Stefanov

##### Then Read:
* [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) - Addy Osmani
* [You Don't Know JS: Scope and Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) - Kyle Simpson

### Editors and IDEs:

Recommended:
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
  * [Vundle (vim bundle), the plugin manager for vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
  * [pathogen.vim, an alternative to Vundle, although I recommend Vundle](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - **Recommend**, although I recommend using it in Vintage mode (i.e. as a Vim editor)
* [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) - not quite ready for prime time
* [WebStorm - by far the best IDE for JavaScript development](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

Command Line:
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) or [on github](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [rcm]()
* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) - perhaps better than oh-my-zsh, although I got on the oh-my-zsh bandwagon before antigen became a viable alternative
* [more awesome zsh plugins and frameworks](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins)

OS X application management:
* [homebrew - The missing package manager for OS X](brew.sh) - on github at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew:

## One More Quote to Live By

> How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.
> From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates. ― Epictetus
